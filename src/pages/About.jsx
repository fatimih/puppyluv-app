            <h3>Walking has always been a meaningful part of my lifeâ€”it's where I find connection, especially with pups. My natural curiosity</h3>
            <p>helps me understand each dog's unique personality, making sure they always feel safe and loved. Having spent most of my life traveling and living in different parts of the world, I've been welcomed into many homes, and I truly value respecting spaces and creating a sense of comfort for pets and their humans.</p>

            <br />** "Tima-too" came from childhood. My parents would ask my older sisters to clean their room, 
              and they would say "but what about Tima?" and my parent's would reply, 
              "...and Tima-too!" Later it became an endearing family name for me.
